-Foster teamwork with clearly defined roles and responsibilities.
-Follow best practices in coding, version control, testing, and deployment.

Tech Stack:
-Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React or similar framework)
-Version Control: Git & GitHub
-Design Tools: Figma (for UI/UX prototyping)
-Backend & Database: (Not explicitly mentioned, but typically Node.js/Express + PostgreSQL/MongoDB for a full-stack app)
-Testing: Unit & integration testing (tools like Jest, React Testing Library)

Key Deliverables:
-GitHub repo with proper documentation (README, project structure).
-Figma designs for UI/UX planning (color schemes, typography, component structure).
-Reusable frontend components with a well-documented architecture.
-Team role assignments and contribution tracking.
-Deployment of a functional web application.

This project serves as a hands-on learning experience in full-stack development, teamwork, and industry best practices.


## UI/UX Design Planning

### Design Goals
- Create an intuitive, responsive interface for seamless property browsing and booking
- Ensure fast loading times and smooth navigation
- Maintain visual consistency with clean typography, spacing, and color schemes
- Follow accessibility best practices (WCAG compliance)

### Key Features
- Property search & filtering
- High-quality images in listings
- Interactive maps (location preview)
- User reviews & ratings
- Secure & simple checkout flow

### Page Descriptions

| Page | Description |
|------|------------|
| Property Listing View | Displays available properties as cards with images, price, location, and ratings. Includes search/filter options. |
| Listing Detailed View | Shows full property details (photos, amenities, host info, reviews, booking calendar). |
| Simple Checkout View | A minimal, step-by-step booking form (dates, guest count, payment, confirmation). |

### Why User-Friendly Design Matters
- Reduces bounce rates - A confusing layout drives users away
- Improves conversions - Smooth checkout = more completed bookings
- Enhances trust - Professional design increases credibility
- Mobile-first approach - Over 50% of bookings happen on phones
